-- A MiddleWare is a Function that interceps every HTTP request and response
-- It allows us to run code before a request is processed by a specific endpoint and after response is generated , enabling task like
   adding headers, logging, or mesuring performance
-- The middleware runs for every HTTP request to any endpoint 
-- MiddleWare applies globally to all HTTP request (not just a specific endpoints) unless filtered by logic inside the middleware
   (e.g, checking the request URL)

   -------------- CREATING MIDDLEWARE ----------

   -- Middleware is created using the @app.middleware("http") deorator on a async Function
   -- Middleware function takes:
      - request: the incoming HTTP request
      - call_next: A function that passes the request to the next layer (path operation) and returns the response
